# Operating System Scheduler Simulator

  <p><strong>The objective of this project is to simulate the scheduling procedures utilized by operating systems in a comprehensive manner. Through the implementation of various scheduling algorithms, users can analyze and assess their performance across different scenarios. The project seeks to enhance understanding of scheduling concepts and enable comparison of the efficacy of different algorithms.</strong></p>

## Features

- Implementation of the following scheduling algorithms:
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
- Generate detailed timeline logs to track process movements based on the implemented algorithms for simulating scheduling processes.
- States in the scheduling procedure:

  - NEW
  - READY
  - RUNNING
  - WAITING
  - TERMINATED

### Requirements

- C++ compiler (C++17 e.g. GCC or CLANG)
- Git CLI tool (or Git GUI client) to clone the repository.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/vandanasnh/CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulation`
2. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and Compile the source code using the following command: `./run.sh <your-test-file-path.csv>` (the program will also run after using this command)
3. Run the compiled executable: `./program`

### Usage Guide

1. Prepare a CSV file containing the processes of the job queue in the following format:
   ```
   process_id,arrival_time,cpu_time1,cpu_time2,io_time
   ```
   - **process_id**: The process unique identifier.
   - **arrival_time**: The time at which the process arrives.
   - **cpu_time1**: The first CPU burst time duration.
   - **cpu_time2**: The second CPU burst time duration.
   - **io_time**: The I/O burst time duration for the process.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. After the execution is completed, the following log files will be generated:
   ```
   ├── FCFS-Algorithm-Analysis.log
   ├── FCFS-Processes-Analysis.log
   ├── FCFS.log
   ├── MLFQ-Algorithm-Analysis.log
   ├── MLFQ-Processes-Analysis.log

   ├── RR-Processes-Analysis.log

   ├── SJF-Algorithm-Analysis.log
